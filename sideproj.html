                    <p2>The Scaffold Service is a consultation and therapy service for looked after and adopted children. The client asked for a logo that represents their service aim, based on a briefly drawn mockup of what his inital idea. <Br></Br>
                    
                        
                    This included a background of “adult” silhouettes in the placement as though it looks like they are holding arms which in turn created a ladder effect as each arm sits on top of the each other representing the idea of a scaffold. Standing in front of the “adult” silhouettes as a main focus was a smaller character, to represent a child surrounded by the support of adults. I designed multiple variations, some with more detail than others, as well as different colours and typography choices etc. In the end, the client opted towards the orange, simplistic variation shown on the right and was very pleased with the outcome. </p2>

                    <p2>Last Summer, I felt it was important to keep up and improve my illustrative skills. Inspired by my friend that had started tonal drawing for family and friends, I thought I could do the same with colourful, realistic digital illustrations. <br><br>
                    I created a series of nine illustrations using my own images, starting with close-up photographs as this was easier to illustrate details. However I also challenged myself to illustrating photographs of multiple people and animals. I gifted my prints to friends and famiy which recieved such a great response, as well as posting them on my instagram page recieving future requests from other people who also loved my illustrations.</p2>

                    <p2>Lead the Way is an annual student conference held by students of Ulster University. I was asked to design a logo that would be printed on t-shirts for the year group to wear on the day of the conference.<Br><br>
                    The client suggested the idea of using arrows so I began sketching out different possibilities which lead me to the favourite design shown on the right. The focus of this project was more so on typography which I believe is successfully incorporated into the design.</p2>

                    <p2>The brief was to design a ticket and poster for a charity event hosted by one of my friends, a student of University of Edinburgh. They were holding a game of bingo to raise money for Diabetes UK. The theme of the event was Saint Patrick's Day, which I had to design for accordingly. <br><Br>
                    Using one of my Special Occasicons (designed in a previous project avaiable to <a class="viewhere" href="https://loosecookie.tumblr.com/tagged/ixd302" target="blank" >view here</a>) for Saint Patrick's Day, I altered it slightly and incorporated it in the ticket and poster design.

                    <p2>SBD Events is a bespoke service adding creative flair to even the most unusual and challenging venues. They required a few illustrations to visualise their ideas for a marquee design so that they can show their client their vision for a particular event.<br><Br>
                    Based on their description of how they planned the marquee to look, I design a variation of illustrations resulting to the completed two images on the right - one is a view from the outside and another showing the inside view. SBD Events was very impressed with the outcome as believe it visualised exactly what they imagined.
