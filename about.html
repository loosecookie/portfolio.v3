    <h2>UX Designer (Placement)</h2>
    <p2>During this academic year, I'm working as a UX Designer for Cirdan. Cirdan is a leading provider of innovative software and imaging solutions that enhance and speed up the diagnosis of patient. As a UX Designer, I’m working on designing a web version of their Laboratory Information System. <br>
    • Day to day I am outlining user stories, drawing up workflow diagrams, designing icons, sketching wireframes, creating prototypes and much more. This has introduced me to a number of new tools and improved my skill set.<br>
    • As part of the ‘Community of Practice’ group, we set up meetings and regular trips to gain feedback from our customers through holding design workshops.<br></p2></div>

    <h2>Graphic Designer and Illustrator</h2>
    <p2>SBD Events is a bespoke service that adds creative flair to any venue. My role, as a freelance designer, involves designing graphics when required mostly for advertising purposes including most recently an business advertisement in the Ulster Tatler Magazine.

    <h2>UX Designer (Work Experience)</h2>
    <p2> Skurio (formally known as RepKnight) are a Belfast based cybersecurity firm. I had the opportunity to spend time with the UX team.<br>
            • I joined their daily round up meeting during which they shared ideas, as well as progress and outcomes of their current tasks.<br>
            • I was able to observe their design process, from identifying the problem by using analytics, to idea generation and paper prototyping.<br>
            • I was set a similar UX task to what they were currently working on, that involved the development of a help guide for their current site.<br>
            • I also got portfolio feedback which allowed me to continue improving.</p2></div>
